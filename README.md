## 🧩 Adding Routes

To add new routes to the application, update the `Routes.jsx` file:

```jsx
import { useRoutes } from "react-router-dom";
import HomePage from "pages/HomePage";
import AboutPage from "pages/AboutPage";

const ProjectRoutes = () => {
  let element = useRoutes([
    { path: "/", element: <HomePage /> },
    { path: "/about", element: <AboutPage /> },
    // Add more routes as needed
  ]);

  return element;
};
```

## 🎨 Styling

This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The configuration includes:

- Forms plugin for form styling
- Typography plugin for text styling
- Aspect ratio plugin for responsive elements
- Container queries for component-specific responsive design
- Fluid typography for responsive text
- Animation utilities

## 📱 Responsive Design

The app is built with responsive design using Tailwind CSS breakpoints.


## 📦 Deployment

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

### 🌐 GitHub Pages Deployment

There are two common GitHub Pages scenarios:

1. User / Org site (https://your-username.github.io) → base should be '/'
2. Project site (https://your-username.github.io/your-repo/) → base must be '/your-repo/'

This project is pre-configured for a project site with base set to `/e-gramsetu/` in `vite.config.mjs`.
If your repository name is different, edit that file (or override via the `BASE_PATH` env variable in CI).

#### 1. Create the GitHub repository
```
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main
```

#### 2. Add the GitHub Actions workflow
This repo now includes `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` which automatically:
- Installs dependencies
- Builds the site (output in `build/`)
- Creates a `404.html` (for React Router deep links)
- Publishes to GitHub Pages

#### 3. Enable Pages
In GitHub UI: Settings → Pages → Source = GitHub Actions (no branch selection needed with the new Pages workflow).

#### 4. Verify
After pushing to `main`, check the Actions tab. When the workflow finishes you'll get a URL like:
```
https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo>/
```

If you see broken CSS/JS assets, it's almost always a base path mismatch—ensure `base` in `vite.config.mjs` matches `/<your-repo>/`.

#### 5. Custom Domain (optional)
Add a `CNAME` file in `public/` with your domain (e.g. `portal.example.com`) and configure DNS (CNAME pointing to `<username>.github.io`). Remove the repository base (set base to '/') if you serve from a root custom domain.

### 🛠 Manual (gh-pages branch) Alternative
If you prefer without Actions:
```
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
"deploy": "npm run build && npx gh-pages -d build"
npm run deploy
```
But the provided GitHub Action is the recommended automated path.

### 🔧 Single Page App Routing
The workflow copies `index.html` to `404.html` so React Router routes work on direct refresh.

### ♻️ Environment Overrides
You can override the base path in CI:
```
BASE_PATH=/custom-base/ npm run build
```
This is helpful if you reuse the same code for multiple deployments.
